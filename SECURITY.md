# Security Policy

## Supported versions

We aim to support the latest minor release line.

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you discover a security issue, **do not** open a public issue.
Instead, email the maintainers (see README "Contact") with details and steps to reproduce.
We will acknowledge receipt, investigate, and provide guidance and, where appropriate, a patch release.
